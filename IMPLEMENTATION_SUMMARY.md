## 💻 How It Works

1. **User clicks "Generate Bill"** in Order Modal
2. Button shows loading state ("Generating...")
3. `generateInvoicePDF()` function is called with order data
4. jsPDF creates a PDF document with:
   - Header with company branding
   - Formatted tables with order details
   - Tax calculations (CGST/SGST)
   - Payment information
   - Professional footer
5. PDF automatically downloads to user's device
6. Button returns to normal state

## 🔧 Customization Points

You can easily customize (see `INVOICE_CUSTOMIZATION.md` for details):

1. **Company Information** - Line 76 in `generateInvoice.ts`
2. **Logo** - Line 96 in `generateInvoice.ts`
3. **Colors** - Line 99 in `generateInvoice.ts`
4. **GST Rates** - Search for "1.18" and "9%" throughout the file
5. **HSN Codes** - Line 142 in `generateInvoice.ts`
6. **Footer Text** - Line 281 in `generateInvoice.ts`

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. ✏️ **Update Company Details** in `generateInvoice.ts`:
   - Company name, address, city
   - GSTIN number (currently: `07XXXXX1234X1ZX`)
   - PAN number (currently: `XXXXX1234X`)
   - State and state code
   - Contact email and phone

2. 🖼️ **(Optional) Add Company Logo**:
   - Place logo in `/client/public/`
   - Update logo section in `generateInvoice.ts`

3. 🔢 **Verify HSN Codes**:
   - Current default: `30049099` (Ayurvedic products)
   - Update if your products use different HSN codes

### Testing Steps:
1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Login to admin dashboard
3. Navigate to Orders section
4. Click on any order to open modal
5. Click "Generate Bill" button
6. Verify PDF downloads with correct information
7. Check all sections are properly formatted
8. Test with orders containing multiple items
9. Test with orders containing shipping charges

### Optional Enhancements:
- Add company logo image
- Implement email invoice functionality
- Add QR code for payment
- Support multiple invoice templates
- Add digital signature
- Multi-language support
- Custom watermarks for different statuses

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Logo**: Currently text-based, image logo requires implementation
2. **State Code**: Hardcoded to "XX" for customer, needs dynamic mapping
3. **GSTIN**: Customer GSTIN not captured in current order schema
4. **HSN Codes**: Single default HSN code for all products
5. **Multi-currency**: Currently only supports ₹ (INR)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all order data is present
3. Ensure jsPDF dependencies are installed
4. Refer to `INVOICE_CUSTOMIZATION.md` for detailed customization guide
